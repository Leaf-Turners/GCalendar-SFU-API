## Script OverView

This video showcases the seamless integration of our Python SFU API Wrapper with the Python Google Calendar API. In this demonstration, we highlight our hackathon project's functionality, which involves retrieving exam and lecture schedules 

for Fall 2023 CMPT 120 courses from SFU and seamlessly incorporating them into a Google Calendar. This video provides just one example of the versatile applications of our Python SFU API Wrapper project. Please note that the video may have some delay due to the synchronous call times of the Google Calendar API.
